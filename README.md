# DevSecOps-Automation Project
This project implements a DevSecOps pipeline for integrating security scanning throughout the application development lifecycle within the AWS environment. The pipeline leverages various tools to identify and address security vulnerabilities early, ensuring a more secure and robust application.
# Objectives:

# Implementation:
This project involves configuring CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and integrating the chosen security scanning tools (SonarCloud, Snyk, TruffleHog) with the pipeline.  Additionally, IAM roles and policies need to be set up to grant the pipeline and build services access to the CodeCommit repository and required AWS resources.
# Code Repository (AWS CodeCommit) 
This serves as the central repository where developers store their application code.
# SonarCloud (SAST) Static Application Security Testing
Performs Static Application Security Testing (SAST) by analyzing the application code directly in CodeCommit for vulnerabilities like SQL injection, insecure coding practices, and potential code smells.
# TruffleHog
Scans code for secrets like passwords, API keys, and other sensitive information that might be accidentally committed to the repository.
# Snyk (SCA)
Conducts Software Composition Analysis (SCA) by scanning dependencies within the code for known vulnerabilities. This identifies potential risks introduced by third-party libraries used in the application.
# Build and Test (AWS CodeBuild)
This service builds the application and executes the security scans mentioned above.
# Deployment Pipeline (AWS CodePipeline)
Orchestrates the entire development and security testing process.
# Upon a code commit in CodeCommit
- CodePipeline triggers a build in CodeBuild.
- CodeBuild retrieves the code, runs SonarCloud SAST, Snyk SCA, and TruffleHog scans, and integrates the results into the pipeline.
- CodePipeline evaluates the scan results. If vulnerabilities are detected, it can notify developers or prevent deployment until the issues are addressed.
# OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) 
Zap Proxy is used as a Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tool. DAST involves running the application to and analyze its behavior for vulnerabilities. This can be a valuable addition for a comprehensive security assessment.
